## Example 6: Thumbnail Generator

This example shows different ways of optimizing a specific task: generating
thumbnails for images.

To try this out, you need to provide a large set of images in the `images`
directory.  Check out the `setup.sh` script for a suggested website that you
can use to download a lot of images.

Once you have the images, you can try out the different alternatives to
the thumbnail generator by running:

```
time ./orig_thumbnail_generator.py
time ./thumbnail_generator.py
```

These two are the ones shown in the video.  The others were additional
alternatives that didn't make it into the video, but that you can check out as
well.
