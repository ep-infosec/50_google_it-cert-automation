# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate - Troubleshooting and Debugging

During this course, we showed a bunch of examples that had problems and
required fixing. The scripts and programs showed in the examples are included
in this repository.

When there was a bug (or more) to be fixed, the directories called `orig`
include the code before fixing and the ones called `fixed` have the code after
the fix was applied. When several alternatives were shown in the videos, the
directories include the different alternatives shown.

Each directory also has a README file with some additional explanations.
