## Example 10: Script that takes a lot of memory

This example shows a Python script that takes more and more memory as it run.

To run this script, you'll need to install some additional Python modules and
download the data that needs to be processed. You can do this using the
`setup.sh` script.

The `contents_stats_simple.py` contains the necessary changes to do memory
profiling over the code. Once it's done running, you can check out what the
problem is and then try out some possible solutions.
