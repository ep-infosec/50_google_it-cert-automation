# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate - Using Git and GitHub

During this course, we showed a bunch of different Python files, which are
included in this repository.

We also created and used a bunch of different Git repos throughout the course.
The files contained in the Git repos shown in the videos are in the directories
stored inside the repos/ folder. However, the history of creating and modifying
those files is not contained in this repo.
